AVR-Libraries
=============

Libraries for AVR microcontrollers. Might work with others as well with some modifications

Some code might not work because it needs to be updated to the new format that is used in templatec.c/h
In atmega328x there are some peripheral libraries to manage SPI, UART, I2C etc. These are used in IC-specific code like pca9685 and others.
